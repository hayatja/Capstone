# AUTOMOW -- Capstone
4th Year Electrical Engineering Project

## Project Goals
1. **Environment Analysis:** The robot must be able to use its array of sensors to be able to
analyze its environment and operate accordingly
2. **Navigation System:** The robot must be able to determine its position within the user’s
lawn and determine the most efficient path while taking into consideration all obstacles
that may be present
3. **Remote Control:** The robot must be able to be controlled remotely using a mobile
application (START, STOP & return to base and PAUSE), which should allow for certain settings to be modified based on the users’
preferences
4. **Lawn Maintenance:** The robot must be able to use its sensors to determine the overall
condition of the lawn to be able to cut and treat it accordingly
